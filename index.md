The Yahoo Open Source Developer Guide covers all relevant information to publishing, using, contributing to, promoting, and growing open source at Yahoo. 

> The Yahoo Open Source Program Office (OSPO) provides services to help developers with their open source needs. These services are highlighted in this guide. Employees can check out the OSPO Welcome Page on our intranet page (on The Street) and can contact the OSPO team via email ospo@ or Slack #opensource with questions. We've made a redacted version of this guide public for others to consider leveraging at their company and to invite feedback to help us improve our services.
