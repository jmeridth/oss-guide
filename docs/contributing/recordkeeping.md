# Special Recordkeeping for Special Projects

Some projects require us to keep records of who we've authorized to contribute to those projects. Below are some of the more common project types and how we handle record keeping. If you contribute to these projects, please review the process listed below. If you have any questions, contact the OSPO on our internal slack channel at #opensource or email ospo@.

## Contribute to Google Projects

Google requires corporate contributors be listed on a list that Yahoo's OSPO maintains with Google. To contribute to a Google Open Source Project, complete the following steps:

1. Go to your Github [Emails](<https://github.com/settings/emails>) Settings page on your personal GitHub account.
1. Add your yahooinc.com email address as either a primary or backup email address. This helps Google's Bot determine that you are a Yahoo employee and your contribution to their project is therefore authorized by our OSPO. Note: You can make your email address private if you like. We ask that you remove it when you leave Yahoo.
1. Use your yahooinc.com email address for any contributions to Google projects that you make on behalf of Yahoo. For example, for projects that use git for source control, use the ``git config`` command to set your email address.
1. Request to be added to the GoogleGroup whitelist for Yahoo contributors to Google open source projects.

Once we add you to the list, you'll be able to contribute to Google's projects.

## Contribute to Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Projects

Yahoo has dozens of active participant positions in [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) projects. Some employees are Project Management Committee (PMC) members, chairs, or committers. Apache requires contributors to sign CLAs. For details, see Apache's [contributor](https://community.apache.org/contributors/) page. Currently, we contribute to Apache Druid, Hadoop, HBase, Hive, OMID, Oozie, Pig, Phoenix, Pulsar, Spark, Storm, Tez, and Traffic Server (and probably others too).  

Before contributing to an Apache project:
1. Open a Jira ticket to request authorization to sign the CLA.
1. We'll add you to our apache-contribtors@ internal mailing list.
1. We'll put you in touch with an internal contact related to the project you seek to contribute to.

Please keep in mind that Apache has a well-articulated process for accepting contributions. If you are becoming an Apache contributor, seek to become a committer, or participate in Apache projects in other meaningful ways, please review the [Apache Community Guidelines](http://community.apache.org/) website to learn more about Apache-etiquette, the Apache Way, and details about Apache projects document [License and Notices](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html) information in projects.
